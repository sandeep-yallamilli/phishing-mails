        <h2>Security Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            The email is flagged by security systems (Cisco IronPort, Microsoft ATP) for containing a PDF attachment identified as carrying the Remcos RAT, a known remote access Trojan used for unauthorized access and control of infected systems. The tactic involves using a seemingly legitimate business RFQ to lure recipients into opening the malicious PDF attachment. The email header and content attempt to appear authentic and professional to increase the likelihood of engagement.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            This email is a phishing attempt leveraging a business RFQ theme to distribute malware via a PDF attachment. Recipients should not open the attachment or respond to the email. The incident should be reported to the organization's cybersecurity team for further investigation and mitigation.
