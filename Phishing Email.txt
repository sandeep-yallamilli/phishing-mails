Security Analysis:

The email is flagged by security systems (Cisco IronPort, Microsoft ATP) for containing a PDF attachment identified as carrying the Remcos RAT, a known remote access Trojan used for unauthorized access and control of infected systems.
The tactic involves using a seemingly legitimate business RFQ to lure recipients into opening the malicious PDF attachment.
The email header and content attempt to appear authentic and professional to increase the likelihood of engagement.
Conclusion:
This email is a phishing attempt leveraging a business RFQ theme to distribute malware via a PDF attachment. Recipients should not open the attachment or respond to the email. The incident should be reported to the organization's cybersecurity team for further investigation and mitigation.

Block and quarantine the email and attachment.
Alert users about the phishing attempt and educate them on recognizing similar threats.
